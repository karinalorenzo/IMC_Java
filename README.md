## Project Description
This project is a Body Mass Index (BMI) calculator written in Java. It allows users to input their weight (in kilograms) and height (in meters) to compute their BMI. Then, it classifies the result into one of the following categories based on standard ranges:

- **Severe Thinness**: BMI < 16
- **Moderate Thinness**: 16 â‰¤ BMI < 17
- **Mild Thinness**: 17 â‰¤ BMI < 18.5
- **Normal Weight**: 18.5 â‰¤ BMI < 25
- **Overweight**: 25 â‰¤ BMI < 30
- **Obese Class I (Mild Obesity)**: 30 â‰¤ BMI < 35
- **Obese Class II (Moderate Obesity)**: 35 â‰¤ BMI < 40
- **Obese Class III (Severe Obesity)**: BMI â‰¥ 40

## Prerequisites
To run this project, you need to have the following installed:
- **Java 8 or later**

## Installation and Execution
### 1. Clone the Repository (Optional)
If you want to clone this project from a GitHub repository, use the following command:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/BMICalculator.git
```

### 2. Compile the Code
If you prefer to compile the code manually in the terminal, navigate to the directory containing the file and run:

```sh
javac IMCCalculator.java
```

### 3. Run the Program
Once compiled, run the following command to execute the calculator:

```sh
java IMCCalculator
```

If you prefer to run it in an IDE, simply open the `IMCCalculator.java` file and run the `main` function.

## How to Use the Program
The program uses an instance of the `IMCCalculator` class, which takes weight and height as constructor parameters. It then prints the BMI and its corresponding classification.

Example console output:
```sh
BMI: 22.86
Classification: Normal Weight
```
